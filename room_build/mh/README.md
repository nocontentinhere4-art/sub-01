# MakeHuman rig + real mocap (crude preview, not installed in web/room)

- `glb/boy_mh.glb`: the MakeHuman base body (CC0, makehumancommunity/makehuman: base.obj + default.mhskel, 163
  bones with fingers, + default_weights.mhw), metres, feet at y = 0, bones world-aligned at rest. Main bones renamed to
  the room page's names (Hips, Spine02, Spine01, Spine, neck, Head, head_end, Left/Right Shoulder, Arm, ForeArm, Hand,
  UpLeg, Leg, Foot, ToeBase); fingers (metacarpalN, fingerN-M .L/.R) and twist bones keep MakeHuman names. Placeholder
  body: G2 builds the real one on the same skeleton.
- `glb/clips/*.glb`: animation-only clips, 20 fps, retargeted with all fingers from Rokoko mocap (Anderson Rohr
  "Everyday Actions" packs 1 and 7, commercial use allowed). Desk modes: `desk_type` (search: typing), `desk_mouse`
  (clicking: right hand on the mouse), `desk_watch` (videos: relaxed in the chair). They keep the recorded finger motion
  as is (the owner rejected a hand-set pose: it looked stiff). The rest are the full source clips.
- `glb/clips/desk_type_ik.glb`: desk_type with a baked arm IK from the owner's typing photo (elbows bent and close,
  hands together on the home row, pointing forward; wrists pinned at world (0.03, 0.878, 0.32) / (-0.13, 0.878, 0.32), drifting with the recorded wrists (70%) for
  a body whose hips sit at the origin), fingers recorded at 80% strength, thumbs swung toward the space bar, fingertips kept above KEYTOP 0.83 (the pin lifts). Awaiting the owner's verdict.
- `glb/clips/desk_mouse_ik.glb`: the mouse held as in the owner's photos, solved for contact: the palm rests on the
  mouse's back (the wrist pin moves until a point 60% from the wrist to the middle knuckle touches the dome + 1.6 cm),
  and each finger curls until its tip meets the dome (+8 mm), fingers together (ADDUCT_R 2.5), the hand flat and straight
  (pitch 0, yaw 0.08 in), thumb on the inner side, an index click now and then. Mouse: a low dome with its hump at the back (radii x 3.1,
  y 3.6, z front 8 / back 4 cm), hump at (-0.36, 0.807, 0.385) for hips at the origin; fingers 2-5 scan from straight to
  curled for the first touch. In the room, pass the real mouse's centre and size as MOUSE.
- Scripts: `build_mh.mjs` (base GLB), `anim_mh.mjs` (retarget; env DY, YAW, ANIMONLY, NAME), `rename_mh.mjs`.
  The source FBX files are not in the repo.
